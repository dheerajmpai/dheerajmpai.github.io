            <p>
Large language models have taken the world by storm, marking a transformative era in the field of artificial intelligence. 
Models like GPT-4, LLaMA, and Mistral, with their multi-billion parameter designs, have set new benchmarks in natural language understanding and generation, reasoning, powering chatbots, and creative writing.  
These gargantuan models, ranging in size from tens to hundreds of gigabytes, and in cases like GPT-4, even reaching terabyte scale. It's just not possible to train these models using the traditional techniques used in pytorch. Much advanced multi-GPU training techniques are necessary
 
In this article, we delve into the critical differences between traditional deep learning training techniques and the more advanced multi-GPU settings required for these large language models.
Our focus will be on system-level optimizations that enable efficient training of these colossal models. We will specifically explore an implementation of DeepSpeed, a breakthrough in this field, applying it step-by-step. For each component, we'll implement what we learn and conduct a comparative analysis in terms of training time, network overhead, and the maximum achievable model size. 
This exploration is driven by the gap I observed in available resources. There are plenty of resources to learn ML libraries like PyTorch and plenty of resources about how to optimize and use LLMs for inference and their APIs. There seems to be a lack of clear, accessible references that break down the concepts related to training these large models. Through this article, I aim to bridge this knowledge gap, providing a comprehensive guide along with implementations to demystifies the process of training large-scale models.

Enter Deepspeed

DeepSpeed, developed by Microsoft, is an open-source deep learning optimization library that specifically addresses the challenges of training large-scale models efficiently. It offers a suite of features that enable researchers and ML practitioners to train models with billions, or even trillions, of parameters. DeepSpeed achieves this through innovative techniques such as Zero redundandacy optimizer, model parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and data parallelism, alongside memory and bandwidth optimizations. It seemlessly integrates with PyTorch. In this article we will use Deepspeed and pytorch.

              Our method involves a knowledge tracing model combined with a reinforcement learning agent to select the
              best possible next exercise for the user. The tested model significantly outperforms a random policy,
              which was selected as our baseline comparison. These successfully results demonstrate the capabilities of
              reinforcement learning as a viable technique for online learning modules. We have made all code and
              pre-trained models from this research public to encourage further research and development in this domain.

            <p>
              One of the best ways to learn any subject or topic is to be incrementally exposed to different concepts of
              the subject over time. This iterative learning needs to be done in such a way that the concept introduced
              at every step is of a slightly higher complexity as compared to the concepts that the learner already
              knows. This means that the learning process can be enhanced for a learner if the concepts that are
              introduced in each step are scheduled according to the current knowledge state of the learner. The same is
              true if a learner is trying to learn a new language. One of the most effective ways to learn a new
              language is through immersion, but not everyone has access to language immersion programs. We plan to
              tackle this by developing an intelligent agent that can carry out personalized conversations with the
              learner.
            </p>

            <p>This project would have two major components:</p>
            <h5>Knowledge tracing:</h5>

            <p>At every step, in order to personalize the conversations, the agent will keep track of the word-level
              mistakes that the learner makes and use this data to generate a representation of the knowledge state of
              the user (conversely, using the representation of the knowledge state we can predict the probability of a
              user making a mistake on a particular word in a sentence). This knowledge representation is used by the
              agent to generate relevant conversation.</p>

            <h5>Conversation Agent:</h5>

            <p>The conversational agent is responsible for generating new conversations with the learner based on the
              current knowledge state of the user. We explore the applications of Sequence to Sequence models to
              generate the next dialogue for the conversation (where the previous reply from the user and the knowledge
              state of the user can be fed as the input to the model). We train the agent using Reinforcement learning
              algorithms (Q-learning) to find the best action to select a conversation that can help in improving the
              knowledge of the user. The reward for the reinforcement learning algorithm is based on the improvement in
              the knowledge state of the user after having a conversation with the agent.</p>
            <p>Our contributions are summarized as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <!-- <span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span>  -->
                <p>We propose a novel architecture based on Reinforcement learning and Deep knowledge tracing that can
                  help humans in language learning.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We explore novel previously unexplored architectures, especially based on attention, for Deep
                  knowledge tracing in the task of second language acquisition. In particular, we focus on architectures
                  that can be easily integrated with our RL agent.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We train and evaluate a Q-learning based RL agent to intelligently schedule conversations that
                  outperforms the baseline in terms of both cumulative reward and sample efficiency.</p>
